To build the solution the usual make files are used.

There is nothing unusual.
The code corresponding to Prob 1 & 2 - one-level. It could be tested with makeprocs as asked in the problem
The code corresponding to Prob 3 & 4 - fork. It could be tested with makeprocs as asked in the problem
The code corresponding to Prob 5 - two-level. It could be tested with makeprocs as asked in the problem

For each of the problems, the following files were modified:
memory.c  memory.h  memory_constants.h  process.c  process.h  traps.c  traps.h  usertraps.s
